/**
 * `trampoline` can be used to convert recursive algorithms
 * without stack consumption. Calls `fn` with supplied args, if
 * any. If `fn` returns a function, calls that function with no
 * arguments, and continues to repeat, until the return value is
 * not a function, then returns that non-fn value. Note that if
 * you want to return a function as a final value, you must wrap
 * it in some data structure and unpack it after `trampoline`
 * returns.
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @param {*} rest
 * @returns {function(...[*]): *}
